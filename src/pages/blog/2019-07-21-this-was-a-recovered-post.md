I don't have any featured images, but I can write a body.

I'm not sure how long it's worth making this, but whatever, it's no big deal. This one isn't a featured post anyway so it won't appear on the front page I believe. I think. I hope? Whatever I should be able to preview this before publishing it to live as it will use branches. I think. I hope?
